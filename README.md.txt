Exercise 1 – Java Design Patterns

This repository contains Java examples for **Exercise 1** on design patterns. The examples are organized by pattern type:

Folder Structure

CreationalDesignPattern
  Contains examples of creational design patterns, which focus on **object creation**:
  - `SingletonExample.java` – Ensures only one instance of a class exists.
  - `FactoryExample.java` – Creates objects without exposing the instantiation logic.
  - `BuilderExample.java` – Builds complex objects step by step.
  - `PrototypeExample.java` – Creates objects by cloning existing instances.

StructuralDesignPattern 
  Contains examples of structural design patterns, which focus on **object composition** and relationships between classes.
  - *(Add your .java files here, e.g., AdapterExample.java, FacadeExample.java, etc.)*

BehavioralDesignPattern 
  Contains examples of behavioral design patterns, which focus on **communication between objects**:
  - `ObserverExample.java` – Defines a subscription mechanism to notify multiple objects of changes.
  - `StrategyExample.java` – Allows choosing algorithms/strategies at runtime.

How to Run
1. Open the folder in an IDE like **NetBeans**, **Eclipse**, or **IntelliJ**.
2. Compile and run the desired `.java` file for the pattern you want to test.
